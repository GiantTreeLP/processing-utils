# processing-utils
A collection of utilities to aid developers using Processing. Built on Kotlin for even more usefulness.

Example:  
-----
Vector - A nice vector that allows the use of infix operators to behave naturally and less like Java's BigDecimal.

    // Naturally add Vectors together
    Vector(1, 2) + Vector(3, 4) = Vector(4, 6)
    
    // Multiply by a skalar
    Vector (1, 1, 1) * 10 = Vector(10, 10, 10)
